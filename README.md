Project Pac: A Bite Out Of Time
Project Pac is a action/adventure game based off the 1980 arcade game PAC-MAN from Namco. Project Pac adds a wide variety of levels, characters, abilities, and boosts to the original game format, as well as complicated ghost AI and a fun story.

Requirements:
Oracle Java 8 or equivalent
JavaFX
e(FX)clipse 
(If new java fx project is not showing up follow instructions here to install javaFX in eclipse https://o7planning.org/en/10619/install-efxclipse-into-eclipse).

Install:
Open eclipse
Choose the src folder as the workspace (../[git folder]/src/ProjectPac/…)
Create new javafx project (New -> Other -> JavaFx  -> New JavaFX project)
Enter the project name “ProjectPac” (case-sensitive)
Wait for project to build.
Run in eclipse.

Run:
Have fun!
Progress is automatically saved to loaded file at the end of each level. 
Characters unlock after certain levels are completed, the story will give you hints as to which character a certain level will unlock.

Notes:
Main is located in the “application” package/folder.
Autosave will create itself in the Project Pac folder if one does not already exist, autosave is the default save.
We have included a separate save file (called gameComplete.txt) which can be loaded from the start screen that has every level and character unlocked. 
If you want a fresh save just delete the autosave.txt and run the application.
